My application is based on the world we are living currently. Having Covid in our life and having long lockdown has forced people to be indoors and not move out as much. Because of this, there is a lot awareness raisers going around the internet of how people neglecting their exercise and not even getting the minimum. This applies to students the most as they arenâ€™t required going in to school as it is all being done online and as a result they stay in the house all rather then being in school having physical exercise such as walks in break times or just generally walking from class to class. My Mobile App is based on solving this solution a little at a time.
